# presentation
The purpose of this repostitory is to help building presentations , written in .md files 
to store images and media file 

based on this js framework:  https://revealjs.com/

### Ideal setup:
- you want to create a presentations called " Middleware versus MVC"
- create a folder /middleware
- add an index.md file in this folder , where will be the presentation text
- upload media files in the /middleware folder 
- once you are happy with it, make a PR in main branch, which will trigger the build by GHA, which will do the npm install and other goodies
- the end result will be a presentation like: https://presentation.dotkernel.org/middleware **which will stay unchanged for long time**
- if you want to edit the presentation , make a PR and re-build the page , and redeploy it somewhere
